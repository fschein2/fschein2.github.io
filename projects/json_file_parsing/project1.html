            <p>
                This project was for my Software Engineering class (CSCE 247) and we as a group aimed to 
                create a management tool to directly help with software management projects. The group I 
                was apart of consisted of myself and 3 others all with listed roles in the group. We had 
                a developer, designer, writer, and project manager. I had the role of project manager which 
                meant I had to schedule meetings for our group and assign tasks to myself and the other 
                members as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first step to this project was defining the requirements for the software tool. After 
                meeting with the client (our professor) we created a list of requirements followed by a 
                complete requirements document that included a list of possible stakeholders, constraints 
                surrounding the project, an overall description, business use cases, functional and 
                non-functional requirements, and a competetive analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we created a detailed UML that included all classes and enumerations that would be 
                included in the project. After working on it and making several iterations of the UML 
                we came to a finalized version that was included in our complete design document that 
                included a system overview, environment overview, an explanation of data storage with 
                example json files, a detailed description of the UML class diagram, and sequence diagrams.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, we have the first of the two implementation stages. In this first sprint we are doing 
                all of the backend implementation. Following the sprint we will go through a testing stage 
                and then we will begin the second sprint. The second sprint will be for the GUI implementation.
                A testing stage will also be conducted following this sprint.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we will present the project to our client with the goal of providing them a project 
                managing tool that properly represents exactly what they wanted in their tool.
