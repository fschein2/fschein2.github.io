    <h1>College Football Stadiums</h1>
    <p>
        Stadiums in college football are a huge deal and sometimes
        are one of the most recognizable aspects about a team.  
        Stadiums can be on campus or off campus, but when they are 
        on campus it seems like it is the heart and soul of a 
        college campus.  The biggest stadiums in college football can 
        hold over 100,000 people.  The loudest games can reach up to 
        130 decibels which as loud as a gunshot at close range.

        Every Saturday (and sometimes other days of the week) fans travel 
        across the country to watch their favorite teams play at their 
        stadium.  The students, the fans locally, and the fans that traveled
        come together outside the stadium to tailgate these football games.  
        The stadium ultimately comes host to an all day event regardless of 
        the time of the game.  When it is finally gametime tens of thousands 
        of fans walk into the packed stadium to watch their team play in one
        of the loudest environments in the world.
